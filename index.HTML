            <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
            <p id="indent"><span class="firstword">Variable Declaration</span>Javascript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment(a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of the environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p id="indent"><span class="firstword">Variable Assignment</span> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Var X;
            <p id="indent"> <span class="firstword">Data</span>Date Types Datea types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are  Javascript primitives: Boolean - <span class="datawords">true</span> or <span class="datawords">false</span>; null - <span class="datawords">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="datawords">42</span> or <span class="datawords">3.14159</span>; String - <span class="datawords">"Coding Dojo Rocks!;</span> Array - <span class="datawords">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo"]</span> and Object - <span class="datawords">{first_name:'Jane',last_name:"Doe"}</span></p>
            <p id="indent"><span class="firstword">Conditions</span> when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. Therer are the following conditional statements; <span class="datawords">if</span> a specific condition is true, do this in our code block; <span class="datawords">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="datawords">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
            <p> <span class="firstword">Loops</span> There are many different types of loops in very programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repear an action some number of times. Imaging you have to run a mile, well you run aroun the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
            </p>
            <p> <span class="firstword">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our fuction this till run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, We open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the top of the table; we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call out function over and over and over again.</p>
